Aya is a Discord bot coded in JavaScript with
[discord.js](https://discord.js.org/). Created to empty out my Cleverbot free
quota, she's _yet another_ Discord Cleverbot.

information. If you plan to use any part of this source code in your own bot, I
would be grateful if you would include some form of credit somewhere.
